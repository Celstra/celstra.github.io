      <p class="intro">I am also a hobbyist. This is a small site that I run to show some of my other endeavors into web programming and making small web apps. This site will change over time as I learn and grow as an artist.</p>

        <h3>Digital Art Director</h3>
        <p>Based on the THUMB WAR : Design Iteration Combat Simulation by Paul Richards. These are real prompts that you would see while working in a studio and an art director would come to you and say "Hey! give me this or that." So I went ahead and designed a really simple web app to help in making thumbnails followed by revisions.</p>

        <h3>Creature Generator</h3>
        <p>I built out this creature generator for Tressa Geniets who runs a Facebook Group called 'Wildlife and Creature Design Studies and Prompts'. She is super cool and recently launched a website where you can find the generator that I created matching the style of her website.</p>

        <h3>Oathsworn: Into the Deepwood Might Deck Manager</h3>
        <p>I kickstarted oathsworn and wanted to make a might deck manager since the decks are quite small and can be hard to shuffle. I am also thinking of ways to improve this one as well. Let me know if there is something you want to see added.</p>
